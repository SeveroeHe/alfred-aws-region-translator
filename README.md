# alfred-aws-region-translator


## Description
This workflow helps translate region-related info into detailed AWS region info. 

Currently supported info includes region code (ex: BJS), region name(ex: US-WEST-1) and detailed location description. 

I'm tired of searching for region code/name mapping through operation websites/wiki during my daily work and that's how this workflow come into place.

## Usage
replace "{query}" to be specific region-related input, see examples below
```
rg {query}
```

## Screenshots

## Todo
1. support ambiguous search 
2. support clickboard
